# FireJS: JavaScript Sensitive Information Scanner by Padayali-JD

**FireJS** is a powerful tool designed to scan JavaScript files for sensitive information such as hardcoded URLs, API endpoints, usernames, passwords, API keys, version information, email addresses, phone numbers, and other security-related data. This tool can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications and ensure sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code.

Developed by **@jrhackerman**.

## Features

- Detects **hardcoded URLs**.
- Identifies **API endpoints** in JavaScript files.
- Searches for **hardcoded usernames** and **passwords**.
- Finds **API keys**, **authentication tokens**, and other sensitive information.
- Identifies **email addresses** and **phone numbers**.
- Detects **version information**.
- Option to scan local files or fetch remote JavaScript files via URL.
- Bypasses SSL certificate verification when fetching remote JavaScript files.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running FireJS

You can run **FireJS** in two ways:

1. **Scan a Local JavaScript File**:
   To scan a local file, use the `-f` or `--file` option:
   
   ```bash
   python firejs.py -f /path/to/your/javascript_file.js
   ```

2. **Scan a JavaScript File from a URL**:
   To scan a JavaScript file from a URL, use the `-u` or `--url` option. FireJS will automatically bypass SSL certificate verification if needed.
   
   ```bash
   python firejs.py -u https://example.com/path/to/javascript_file.js
   ```

### Example

```bash
python firejs.py -u https://example.com/app.js
```

Output:
```plaintext

 | |__   _ _ __  ___ 
 |  __| | | '_ \/ __|
